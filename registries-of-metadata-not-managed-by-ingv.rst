5. Registries of Metadata not Managed by INGV
=============================================

The data present in the INGV Data Registry can be linked on an
institutional level to metadata registries not managed at INGV. Here,
the link to two registries in particular is provided for: DataCite,
which allows an identifier DOI to be assigned to the elements and
manages metadata adapted to describing the data produced by scientific
Research, and national registry of spatial data (Repertorio Nazionale
dei Dati Territoriali – RNDT) managed by Agenzia per l'Italia Digitale
(AgID), and that is placed in the context of the European Infrastructure
for Spatial Data (INSPIRE) [1]_. Any adoption of new external
registries, where the need is expressed on an institutional level, will
be assessed in concert between the Data Management Office and the
Department Directors.

In order to comply with the principle of “Data entry minimisation” [2]_,
the metadata needed to describe the entry of data into external
registries are to be extracted directly from the INGV Data Registry in
totally automated fashion, and thus without having to re-enter
information already compiled earlier. The update of the metadata thus
takes place in cascade; upon updating the metadata in the INGV Data
Registry, the metadata associated with the linked data in the external
registries are automatically updated.
