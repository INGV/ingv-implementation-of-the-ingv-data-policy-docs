Data Suitability Verification Procedures
========================================

Once its class is defined, before a data can be entered into the
Registry, its suitability must be verified. The procedure for verifying
this suitability is diagrammed in Figure 1. The information necessary
for the verification is provided to the Data Management Office by the
Data Producer’s Contact (see Chapter 4).

In the case of unstructured data Set for which some technical/scientific
assessment is required, this shall be seen to by the Department
Directors, and shall be acquired prior to the start of the procedure of
entering the data into the Registry.
