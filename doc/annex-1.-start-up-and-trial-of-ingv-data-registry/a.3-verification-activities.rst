A.3 Verification Activities
===========================

The Data Registry verification activities must be aimed at ascertaining
the actual functioning of the implemented databases (in compliance with
the access rules defined in Table 1), and their function in the INGV
data management system (if already implemented). Should there be a link
to external databases (as defined in the “Implementation Document”),
their interoperability must also be verified.
