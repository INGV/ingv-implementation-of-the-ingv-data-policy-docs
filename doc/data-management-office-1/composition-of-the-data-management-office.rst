   case of INGV, the Data Management Office also carries out the role of
   *Open Data Working Group*. The AgID Guidelines also specify that
   “\ \ *for the Open Data Team’s work to be decisive within the
   Administration, it is important for the team to dialogue with the
   most political level, both to obtain the necessary ‘impetus’ from it,
   and to offer proposals and stimuli to political decision-makers*.”
