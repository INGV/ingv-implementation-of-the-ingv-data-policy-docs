Data Management Office
======================

The institution of the Data Management Office responds to the
“Professionalism” principle of DP200. This principle enshrines INGV’s
commitment to allocating the necessary professional resources for the
purpose of implementing the Data Policy.

The Data Management Office has the following purposes, closely
interconnected with one another:

-  Promoting the Open Science paradigm;

-  Managing the Data Registry;

-  Providing technical/scientific support in drawing up contracts or
   conventions that involve managing INGV data.

The Data Management Office promotes the Open Science paradigm,
guaranteeing the progressive opening of the data and the improvement of
their management in keeping with the regulations in force. Towards this
end, the Data Management Office promotes personnel training initiatives
and advances proposals for changes in the management of INGV’s data. The
data processed by the Data Management Office are, exclusively, Research
data as defined in Chapter 1 of this document.

The Data Management Office carries out its activity in compliance with
what is defined herein, operating within the “Services Centre for the
coordination of the activities in support of Research.”

The Data Management Office is instituted by decision of the Executive
Board. Its members are appointed by decree of the President, remain in
office for a three-year term, and may be re-elected only once.
