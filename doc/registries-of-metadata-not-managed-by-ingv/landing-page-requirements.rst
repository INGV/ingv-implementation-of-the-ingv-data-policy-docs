Landing Page Requirements
=========================

The Landing Page is the web page that is associated with the data either
in the INGV and the external registries, which is to say the page the
users arrive on when consulting these registries. In order to harmonize
the information presented on these pages, and for the purposes of
improving INGV’s coordinated image to the outside, the Landing Pages
must contain the following elements.

-  The INGV logo, which clarifies and identifies the paternity of the
   data for the external user, and a direct link to the INGV
   institutional portal. If other institutions are involved in producing
   the data, they must also be clearly identifiable and a link to the
   respective institutional portals must be present.

-  The name and a brief description of the element of the Data Registry
   that is made available, reporting information consistent with that
   stored in the Registry.

-  A comprehensive description of the data that affords potential users
   an informed use, clarifying the purposes with which the data were
   created, if available, provide a list of the scientific and technical
   publications of reference, at all times indicating their DOI code, if
   there is one; the Data Registry may contain one or more references to
   these publications, and it may therefore be hoped that the
   publications reported on the Landing Page are the same ones reported
   in the Data Registry.

-  Direct access to the data or, if it is a question of data with
   non-free access, a clear explanation of the data access procedures.

-  In the case of data associated with elements in the Data Registry
   that belong to a group of elements, make available a link to the
   other Landing Pages that contain the other elements of the group,
   clarifying the nature of the link existing among the group’s various
   data. Above all in the case of groups of elements composed of
   different versions of the same product, it is essential to present
   the user with a link to the other versions, clarifying what the
   differences from one version to the other are, and at any rate
   clarifying what the most up-to-date version is.

-  The bibliographic citation of the data listing the authors, title,
   and the institutions or bodies that control the data. To indicate
   INGV, use the wording “Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia
   (INGV).” The authors must coincide with what is reported in the Data
   Registry; in the case of a large number of persons (for example, more
   than four), it may also include, in addition to the main scientific
   managers, a generic reference to the working group. The citation must
   include, at the end, the DOI code associated with the data, in its
   form resolvable on the Web, preceded by “https://doi.org/.” The
   bibliographical citations must be written in English; a possible,
   additional citation in Italian may also be presented.

-  The list of persons that contributed towards creating the data,
   clarifying which of them is the Scientific Manager and, if present,
   the Technological Manager, consistently with what is reported in the
   Data Registry; the users must be able to contact the Data Manager
   and/or the Technical Manager, and it is therefore necessary to
   publish their e-mail address or, alternatively, it must be possible
   to obtain an interactive tool to receive and provide requests.

-  Indication of the Creative Commons (CC) license as reported in the
   Data Registry, which must be linked to the description web page on
   the Creative Commons site; it will have to be made clear to the users
   what are any limitations on accessing the data, the limitations on
   use, and the limitations of liability on the part of INGV, and any
   notes connected with the legal sphere.

The Data Management Office will see to supporting data Managers in
verifying the presence of all the necessary elements in the Landing
Page, and in particular the information’s consistency with what is
reported in the Data Registry will be guaranteed.
