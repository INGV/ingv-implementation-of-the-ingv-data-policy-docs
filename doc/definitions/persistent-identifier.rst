Persistent Identifier
=====================

Alphanumeric code whose structure is defined within objects management
systems (data, books, persons, physical samples, etc.), some of which
follow open and internationally shared standards (Open Standard). The
adjective “persistent” refers to the characteristic of guaranteeing that
the association between the associated object’s identification code and
its position on the Web is maintained over the long term. This means
that the identifier management system and access to the data are
maintained operational over time.
