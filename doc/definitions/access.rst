Access
======

A user’s authorization or right to access the data via an infrastructure
associated with a database. Access may be broken down, in relation to
the modes of user identification and registration, as follows:

-  Anonymous: in this case, access to the service(s) takes place with no
   identification or accreditation procedure;

-  Registered: in this case, access to the service(s) requires an
   identification by means of accreditation procedures which may be
   automated;

-  Authorized: in this case, access to the service(s) requires specific
   authorization by the database manager.

Depending on the complexity, access to the data may have one or more
functions coded with the abbreviation “AAAI”: user identification
(Authentication), authorization to use the services (Authorization), and
accounting for the use of the services (Accounting). This infrastructure
must guarantee compliance with personal data protection
regulations [1]_.
