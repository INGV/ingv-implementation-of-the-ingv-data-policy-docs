Data Producer
=============

Given that, juridically speaking, the Data Producer is INGV, in this
specific document, applying the legal principle of being one and the
same (in Italian “\ *immedesimazione organica*\ ”), reference made to
“Data Producer” is to be understood as being made to the individual
research employee or research group that produces the data through their
own working activity, with the internal resources (ordinary funds) and
external resources (funds originating from projects, conventions, etc.)
provided by INGV, including the personnel cost.
