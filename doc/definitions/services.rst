Services
========

Any one of the following operations applicable to a database: data
search, display, transfer, transformation, editing, and/or updating. The
individual service available for a database may be:

-  Open: the service is freely available and accessible to all, without
   restrictions;

-  Limited: the service is available, but only under the conditions
   established or agreed upon by/with the holder of the right to exploit
   the intellectual property; a particular case is that of data for
   which a certain type of service (typically the transfer) may be
   accessed, for a predefined period of time.
