Data
====

(understood here in the meaning of Research Data [1]_): individual items
or records of any nature (physical or digital), at any level of
processing, and however organized, as well as research products even if
unpublished, commonly deemed and accepted by the scientific community as
necessary for validating scientific discoveries. In this setting, the
term “data” refers indifferently to the raw data acquired by the sensor,
the physical sample of any nature, or a product obtained from any
analysis on the data at any level of processing, whether automatic or
manual. The following is a definition of types of data cited in the
document:

-  static data: the data, once generated and/or published, is no longer
   updated;

-  dynamic data: the data may be modified or extended after being
   published; these data may be further broken down based on the type of
   variation:

   -  data subject to revision: modifiable for the purpose of improving
      their quality/reliability;

   -  continuously produced data: data produced by sensors that generate
      a time series;

-  monitoring data: data originating from institutional observational
   systems, acquired or produced recurrently and systematically to
   characterize and comprehend the physical and/or chemical processes of
   the Earth system;

-  surveillance data: data processed for purposes of natural risk
   management, civil protection, or public utility, provided to public
   or private, national and/or international bodies and/or institutions,
   in accordance with formal agreements;

-  spatial data [2]_: any geographically localized information;

-  open data: which is to say “usable, reusable, or redistributable
   freely by anyone, also for commercial purposes, subject at most to
   the request for attribution and sharing in the same manner” [3]_.

   document management.
