Data Owner
==========

According to the regulations in force [1]_, the data controller is the
Public Administration that originally formed for its own use or
commissioned from another party the document representing the data or
that has it at its disposal. INGV is therefore the Data Controller
regardless of the data’s Level, whether created with their own human
and/or instrumental resources, or at any rate managed, or if
commissioned for institutional purposes. In the case of complex
situations involving institutions other than INGV, it is necessary to
execute an agreement clarifying the aspects related to control of the
data (e.g. agreements for activities under agreement with the Department
of Civil Protection [2]_). The transfer of a data from one information
system to another does not modify control of the data.” [3]_
